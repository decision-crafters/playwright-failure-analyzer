## üöÄ Immediate Action Required

### 1. Create Demo Repository (10-15 minutes)

The demo repository needs to be created manually. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Create repository
gh repo create decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer-demo \
  --public \
  --description "Live demonstration repository for Playwright Failure Analyzer" \
  --homepage "https://github.com/decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer"

# Step 2: Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer-demo.git
cd playwright-failure-analyzer-demo
```

**Then follow**: `docs/E2E_TEST_REPOSITORY_SETUP.md` for complete setup

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Local Testing (Before Push)
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"

# 2. Check linting
# (if you have linting setup)

# 3. Test validation script (after demo repo exists)
./scripts/validate-demo-repo.sh
```

### Integration Testing (After Demo Repo)
1. Fork demo repository
2. Enable Actions
3. Run "Test with Intentional Failures" workflow
4. Verify issue creation
5. Check issue format and content

feat: Standardize Playwright integration and add E2E validation

BREAKING CHANGE: Default report-path changed from 'test-results.json'
to 'playwright-report/results.json' to align with Playwright's standard
output location when using config file reporters.

**Migration Guide**:
- Update playwright.config.js with JSON reporter:
  reporter: [['json', { outputFile: 'playwright-report/results.json' }]]
- OR explicitly set report-path: 'test-results.json' in workflow

**Phase 1: Standardize Playwright Integration**
- Add Playwright schema validation to detect non-Playwright reports
- Create comprehensive reporter configuration guide (620 lines)
- Update all examples to use config-based approach
- Enhanced error messages with actionable suggestions

**Phase 2: E2E Validation Framework**
- Complete demo repository setup guide
- Validation automation script
- Updated testing documentation with demo repo integration

**Tests**: 4 new validation tests added, all passing (60/61 total)
**Documentation**: 5 new files, 10 files updated

See IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md for complete details.
See examples/playwright-reporters.md for configuration guide.
