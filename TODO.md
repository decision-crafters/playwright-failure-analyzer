## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Important Decisions to Make

1. **Versioning Strategy**
   - Decision: Use semantic versioning (semver)
   - Rationale: Industry standard, clear expectations
   - [ ] Document in CONTRIBUTING.md

2. **Support Policy**
   - Decision: TBD - Define which versions will receive updates
   - Options: Latest only, or latest + previous major version
   - [ ] Document in README.md

3. **AI Analysis**
   - Decision: TBD - Make optional or required?
   - Current: Optional with feature flag
   - [ ] Document recommendation in README.md

4. **Repository Naming**
   - Decision: TBD - Final repository name
   - Suggestions: playwright-failure-analyzer, playwright-test-bundler
   - [ ] Update all documentation with final name

### Open Questions

1. Should we support Playwright versions < 1.x?
2. What's our policy on community contributions?
3. Should we create a Discord/Slack for support?
4. Do we want to create video tutorials?
