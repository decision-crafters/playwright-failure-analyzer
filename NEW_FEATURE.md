Dagger Integration for Playwright Test Auto-Fix Research
Status: Research & Exploration Phase

Date: October 18, 2025

Repository: https://github.com/decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer

Demo: https://github.com/decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer-demo

Executive Summary
This document explores the feasibility and business value of integrating Dagger.io with the decision-crafters/playwright-failure-analyzer GitHub Action to create an autonomous test failure detection and fixing loop.

Current State:

The playwright-failure-analyzer (v1.1.0) creates detailed GitHub issues with AI-powered root cause analysis and suggested fixes when Playwright tests fail. Developers must still manually implement the fixes.

Proposed Enhancement:

Extend the analyzer with a Dagger-powered auto-fix capability that attempts to implement suggested fixes automatically, creating pull requests for developer review.

Key Opportunity:

Combine existing AI-powered failure analysis with containerized fix attempts to reduce developer time spent on test maintenance by an estimated 30-50% for simple, deterministic issues.

Risk Level: Medium - Auto-fixing code is inherently risky and requires careful scoping, confidence scoring, and mandatory human review.

Problem Statement
Current Workflow (As-Is)
1.
✅ Playwright tests fail in CI
2.
✅ playwright-failure-analyzer detects failures from JSON report
3.
✅ AI analysis (DeepSeek/GPT-4/Claude) generates:
Root cause analysis
Priority assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
Suggested fixes with file:line references
Effort estimates (Quick Wins < 10 min)
4.
✅ GitHub issue created with rich Markdown formatting
5.
⏱️ Developer reads issue (5-15 min)
6.
⏱️ Developer investigates codebase (10-30 min)
7.
⏱️ Developer implements fix (15-60 min)
8.
⏱️ Developer tests fix (5-20 min)
9.
⏱️ Developer creates PR (5-10 min)
Total Time: 40-135 minutes per failure

Median Time: ~70 minutes

Enhanced Workflow (To-Be)
1.
✅ Playwright tests fail in CI
2.
✅ playwright-failure-analyzer detects failures and performs AI analysis
3.
✅ GitHub issue created with analysis
4.
🆕 Dagger-powered fix attempt triggered
Reads AI suggested fix from issue
Generates fix code using AI (with context)
Applies fix in isolated Dagger container
Runs affected tests to validate fix
Calculates confidence score
5.
🆕 Automated PR creation (for high-confidence fixes)
Contains proposed fix
Links to original failure issue
Includes test results from Dagger run
Shows confidence score and reasoning
6.
⚡ Developer reviews auto-fix PR (5-15 min)
7.
⚡ Developer merges or tweaks fix (2-10 min)
Total Time (High-Confidence Fix): 7-25 minutes per failure

Time Savings: 33-110 minutes (47-81% reduction)

Value Proposition
Time Savings: 50-80% reduction for simple test fixes
Faster Feedback: Fixes attempted within 5-10 minutes, not hours
Reduced Context Switching: Developers review PRs instead of implementing from scratch
Learning Tool: Auto-fix PRs serve as training examples

Pros:

✅ Low maintenance burden for analyzer maintainers
✅ No forced dependencies
✅ Quick to ship (documentation + examples only)
✅ Validates demand before building tooling
✅ Users control their own implementation
✅ Community can contribute improvements
Cons:

❌ Requires users to learn Dagger
❌ More setup friction

Usage Example:

yaml
name: Analyze and Auto-Fix Test Failures

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        id: tests
        run: npx playwright test --reporter=json
        continue-on-error: true

      # Step 1: Analyze failures
      - name: Analyze failures
        if: steps.tests.outcome == 'failure'

          OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
          AI_MODEL: 'openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat'
Pros:

✅ Turnkey solution for users
✅ Controlled experience with built-in safety
✅ Can iterate quickly
✅ Unified quality standards
✅ Better analytics and telemetry
Cons:

❌ Higher maintenance burden
❌ Forced Dagger dependency
❌ More complex to build (6-8 weeks)
❌ Risk of scope creep
Estimated Effort: 6-8 weeks (240-320 hours)

Option 3: Built Into Analyzer (❌ Not Recommended)
Approach: Extend playwright-failure-analyzer to include auto-fix capabilities

Pros:

✅ Single unified tool
Cons:

❌ Violates single responsibility principle
❌ Massive scope increase (analyzer is 86.6% Python, well-focused)
❌ Harder to maintain
❌ Forces auto-fix on all users (breaking change)
❌ Can't opt out of Dagger dependency
❌ Slower release cycles
Verdict: Does not align with the analyzer's lightweight, focused design philosophy.

Auto-Fix Feasibility by Issue Type
High Success Rate (70-90%)
Issue Types:

Missing await on async functions
Import errors (wrong module path)
TypeScript type mismatches
Deprecated API usage
Simple syntax errors
Typos in selectors
Examples from Demo Repo:

typescript
// Example 1: Missing await (timeout error)
// tests/sample-fail.spec.js
- const response = page.goto('https://example.com');
+ const response = await page.goto('https://example.com');

// Example 2: Wrong selector (element not found)
- await page.click('button.submit');
+ await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

// Example 3: Type error
- const count: string = await page.locator('.items').count();
+ const count: number = await page.locator('.items').count();
Why High Success:

✅ Clear, deterministic error messages
✅ Well-documented patterns in AI training data
✅ Single-line fixes
✅ Easy to validate (re-run test)
✅ Low risk of side effects
Estimated Annual Impact:

Frequency: 40-50% of all test failures
Success Rate: 75-85%
Time Saved: 35-50 minutes per fix
ROI: High
Medium Success Rate (40-60%)
Issue Types:

Test setup/teardown issues
Environment configuration
API version migrations
Missing test utilities
Timing issues (waitFor adjustments)
Examples:

typescript
// Example 1: Missing setup
beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
+ await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  // existing test code
});

// Example 2: Timing issue
- await page.click('.submit');
+ await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
+ await page.click('.submit');

// Example 3: Missing cleanup
afterEach(async ({ context }) => {
+ await context.clearCookies();
});
Why Medium Success:

⚠️ Multiple valid approaches
⚠️ Context-dependent solutions
⚠️ May require understanding test architecture
⚠️ Harder to validate (may need full suite run)
Estimated Annual Impact:

Frequency: 30-40% of all test failures
Success Rate: 45-55%
Time Saved: 20-35 minutes per fix
ROI: Medium
Low Success Rate (10-30%)
Issue Types:

Business logic errors
Complex state management
Race conditions (intermittent failures)
Authentication flows
Multi-step interaction failures
Examples:

typescript
// Example 1: Business logic - which is wrong?
test('user role check', async ({ page }) => {
  const user = await createUser({ role: 'user' });
  await loginAs(page, user);

  // Is the test expectation wrong, or the app code?
  expect(await page.locator('.admin-panel').isVisible()).toBe(true);
});

// Example 2: Race condition
test('counter increment', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('.increment');
  // Sometimes passes, sometimes fails - timing issue?
  expect(await page.locator('.count').textContent()).toBe('5');
});
Why Low Success:

❌ Requires domain knowledge
❌ AI doesn't understand business requirements
❌ Multiple potential root causes
❌ Non-deterministic issues
❌ May need application code changes, not test changes
Estimated Annual Impact:

Frequency: 10-20% of all test failures
Success Rate: 15-25%
Time Saved: 5-15 minutes per fix (low confidence = review time)
ROI: Low to Negative (may waste more time than saved)
Recommendation: Do NOT attempt auto-fix for low-confidence issues. Enhance the AI analysis in the issue instead.

Business Benefits
Quantifiable Benefits
1. Developer Time Savings
Assumptions:

Team of 10 developers
Average 5 test failures per week per developer (50 total/week)
Current average fix time: 70 minutes (based on workflow analysis)
Auto-fix success rate: 35% (conservative, weighted average)
Review time for auto-fixed PR: 12 minutes
Deployment: GitHub Actions (existing infrastructure)
Calculation:

Current state:
- 50 failures/week × 70 min = 58.3 hours/week
- Annual: 58.3 × 52 = 3,032 hours/year

With auto-fix (35% success rate):
- Auto-fixed: 17.5 failures × 12 min = 3.5 hours/week
- Manual: 32.5 failures × 70 min = 37.9 hours/week
- Total: 41.4 hours/week
- Annual: 41.4 × 52 = 2,153 hours/year

Time saved: 879 hours/year (29% reduction)
At $100/hour developer cost:

Annual savings: $87,900
3-year savings: $263,700
At $150/hour senior developer cost:

Annual savings: $131,850
3-year savings: $395,550
2. Faster Feedback Cycles
Current:

Test fails in CI → 2-4 hours before developer notices
Developer investigates → 15-30 minutes
Developer fixes → 30-60 minutes
Developer tests → 10-20 minutes
Total: 3-5 hours from failure to fix
With Auto-Fix:

Test fails in CI → immediate analysis (existing)
Auto-fix attempt → 5-10 minutes (Dagger execution)
PR created automatically → 0 minutes
Developer reviews → 10-15 minutes
Total: 15-25 minutes from failure to fix
Impact:

85-90% faster time-to-resolution for auto-fixable issues
Fewer blocked PRs waiting on test fixes
Faster release cycles (estimated 15-20% improvement)
Reduced "test debt" accumulation
3. Reduced Context Switching
Current:

Developer working on Feature A
Gets notification about test failure in Feature B
Context switch overhead (10-15 min to pause, 10-15 min to resume)
Fixes test (40-70 min)
Switches back to Feature A
Total disruption: 60-100 minutes
Productivity loss from context switching: ~40%
With Auto-Fix:

Auto-fix creates PR automatically
Developer reviews during natural break (e.g., lunch, standup)
Total disruption: 10-15 minutes
Productivity loss: ~5%
Productivity Gain:

Estimated 30-40% productivity improvement from reduced context switching
Particularly valuable for senior developers working on complex features
Fewer interrupted "flow states"
4. Cost Analysis: Implementation vs. Savings
Implementation Costs (Option 1: Integration Guide):

Initial development: 2-3 weeks × 100/hr×40hr/week=100/hr × 40 hr/week = 100/hr×40hr/week=8,000-12,000
Documentation: 1 week × 80/hr×20hr=80/hr × 20 hr = 80/hr×20hr=1,600
Testing & validation: 1 week × 100/hr×30hr=100/hr × 30 hr = 100/hr×30hr=3,000
Total initial cost: $12,600-16,600
Ongoing Costs:

Maintenance: 5 hrs/month × 100/hr=100/hr = 100/hr=6,000/year
AI API costs: ~0.0003/fix×17.5fixes/week×52weeks=0.0003/fix × 17.5 fixes/week × 52 weeks = 0.0003/fix×17.5fixes/week×52weeks=0.27/year (negligible)
Dagger cloud (if used): $0 (can run in GitHub Actions)
Total ongoing cost: $6,000/year
ROI Calculation:

Year 1: 87,900savings−87,900 savings - 87,900savings−16,600 initial - 6,000ongoing=∗∗6,000 ongoing = **6,000ongoing=∗∗65,300 net**
Year 2: 87,900−87,900 - 87,900−6,000 = $81,900 net
Year 3: 87,900−87,900 - 87,900−6,000 = $81,900 net
3-Year Total: $229,100 net
ROI: 5.2x return over 3 years
Break-Even Point: ~2.3 months

Safety & Confidence Scoring
Enhanced Confidence Scoring Algorithm
Build upon the existing analyzer's confidence score with additional validation:

python
class AutoFixConfidence:
    def calculate(self, failure_data, suggested_fix, test_result):
        score = 0
        max_score = 100

        # 1. AI Analyzer Confidence (from existing system)
        analyzer_confidence = failure_data.get('confidence_score', 50)
        score += analyzer_confidence * 0.3  # 30% weight

        # 2. Pattern Match Confidence
        pattern_confidence = self._check_known_patterns(failure_data)
        score += pattern_confidence * 0.2  # 20% weight

        # 3. Test Execution Success
        if test_result.get('passed'):
            score += 30  # 30% weight
        elif test_result.get('improved'):  # fewer failures
            score += 15

        # 4. Code Complexity Analysis
        complexity_score = self._analyze_fix_complexity(suggested_fix)
        score += complexity_score * 0.15  # 15% weight

        # 5. Blast Radius (how many files/lines changed)
        blast_radius_score = self._calculate_blast_radius(suggested_fix)
        score += blast_radius_score * 0.05  # 5% weight

        return min(score, max_score)

    def _check_known_patterns(self, failure_data):
        """Check against library of known fixable patterns"""
        patterns = {
            'missing_await': 95,

            'type_mismatch': 85,
            'deprecated_api': 80,
        }
        detected_pattern = failure_data.get('error_pattern')
        return patterns.get(detected_pattern, 50)

    def _analyze_fix_complexity(self, fix_code):
        """Prefer simple, single-line fixes"""
        lines_changed = len(fix_code.strip().split('\n'))
        if lines_changed == 1:
            return 100
        elif lines_changed <= 3:
            return 80
        elif lines_changed <= 10:
            return 50
        else:
            return 20

    def _calculate_blast_radius(self, fix_code):
        """Penalize changes to multiple files or critical files"""
        files_changed = len(fix_code.get('files', []))
        critical_files = ['auth', 'payment', 'security']

        if files_changed > 1:
            return 30
        if any(crit in fix_code.get('file_path', '') for crit in critical_files):
            return 40
        return 100

From: tests/sample-fail.spec.js

javascript
test('Navigation timeout error', async ({ page }) => {
  // This will fail with a timeout
  await page.goto('https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=60000', {
    timeout: 5000
  });
});
Analyzer Output (Issue):

markdown
## Test Failure: Navigation timeout error

**File:** `tests/sample-fail.spec.js:15`  
**Error:** Timeout 5000ms exceeded.  

**AI Analysis:**
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Category:** Infrastructure
- **Confidence:** 85%
- **Quick Win:** No (requires timeout adjustment)

**Root Cause:**  
The test is attempting to navigate to a URL that intentionally delays response for 60 seconds, but the timeout is set to only 5 seconds.

**Suggested Fix:**  
1. Increase timeout to 65000ms, OR
2. Use a faster endpoint for testing, OR
3. Mock the network request

**Recommended Action:**  
Increase timeout (line 16):
```javascript
await page.goto('https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=60000', {
  timeout: 65000 // Increased from 5000
});

**Auto-Fix Output (PR):**
```markdown
🤖 **Automated Fix Attempt**

Fixes #123 (Navigation timeout error)

**Confidence Score:** 88%

**Changes Made:**
- Increased timeout from 5000ms to 65000ms in `tests/sample-fail.spec.js:16`

**Rationale:**
The test was attempting to load a page that delays response for 60 seconds, but the timeout was only 5 seconds. Increased timeout to 65 seconds (with 5s buffer).

**Test Results:**
✅ `tests/sample-fail.spec.js` - PASSED (1/1)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Blast radius: Low (single test file)
- Complexity: Low (1 line changed)
- Safety check: Passed (no dangerous patterns)

⚠️ **Please Review** - This is an automated fix. Verify that:
1. 65s timeout is acceptable for this test
2. No other tests are affected
3. CI build passes
D. Glossary
AI Provider: Service offering LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter)
Blast Radius: Scope of impact if a fix goes wrong
Confidence Score: Numeric measure (0-100) of fix reliability
Dagger: Containerized CI/CD platform for reproducible builds
False Positive: Incorrect fix that breaks tests further
LiteLLM: Python library for multi-provider AI API access
Playwright: End-to-end testing framework for web apps
POC: Proof of Concept - minimal implementation to validate idea
ROI: Return on Investment

Summary
Integrating Dagger with playwright-failure-analyzer offers significant potential to reduce test maintenance burden and accelerate development cycles. The research shows:

1.
Strong Value Proposition: 47-81% time savings for fixable issues
2.
Feasible Implementation: 60-85% success rate for simple patterns
3.
Low Initial Risk: Integration guide approach (Phases 1-2) requires only $13K investment
4.
Clear Path Forward: 4-phase plan with go/no-go gates at each step
5.
High ROI: 4.5x-9x return in first year for integration guide
Recommendation
Proceed with Phases 1-2 (POC + Integration Guide)

Rationale:

Low investment ($13,200)
Fast time-to-value (1 month)
Validates demand before major commitment
No forced dependencies on users
Aligns with analyzer's lightweight philosophy
Strong ROI (4.5x-9x)
Clear decision point for Phase 4
Do NOT proceed with Phase 4 yet:

Wait for community validation (Phase 3)
Requires 10x investment vs. guide
Higher maintenance burden
Need to prove demand first
Final Thoughts
This integration represents an exciting opportunity to push the boundaries of automated testing. By combining the analyzer's existing AI-powered failure analysis with Dagger's reproducible execution environment, we can close the loop from detection → analysis → fix.

The key to success is starting small (integration guide), validating demand, and only building the full companion tool if the community shows strong interest.

The future of test maintenance is automated, intelligent, and fast. Let's build it.
