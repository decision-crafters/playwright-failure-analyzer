# Basic Workflow Example
# This is the simplest way to use the Playwright Failure Analyzer
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure Playwright to output JSON reports in playwright.config.js:
#    reporter: [['json', { outputFile: 'playwright-report/results.json' }]]
#
# See examples/playwright-reporters.md for complete configuration guide
